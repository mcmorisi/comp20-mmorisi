    <h1>Assignment 4: Security</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The product in question that is being tested for bugs is a
            web application which gets the user's location, adds it to a
            running database of logins, and returns a series of landmarks
            (also from a database) within 1 mile of the user's current
            location. The specific page being tested is a simple index
            page which prints out the username, coordinates, and time of
            all the users' logins. In particular, this analysis will test for
            the potential for HTML or script injection. The project being tested
            was created by Brinley Macnamara.
        </p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>In testing Brinley's application, I used Postman to send simple
            HTTP POST requests to inject HTML elements. I also elected to use
            a text editor (Sublime) to examine her code to find possible
            exploits. I used Google Chrome to view the results of my POST
            requests on Brinley's application.
        </p>
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
        <p>Upon first cloning the Heroku repository, I immediately tried to
            inject some simple HTML into Brinley's application (namely, an
            image element). When examining the source code, I discovered that
            Brinley had already secured her site against HTML injection. From
            there, I tried to submit bad location values, including strings
            and numbers outside of the normal latitude/longitude range,
            but her application was protected against these cases as well. Next,
            I attempted to insert faulty latitude/longitude values in the form of
            arithmetic expressions, which indeed were passed through to the
            server. Finally, I gave her code a full once-over to find any coding
            practices that could affect the performance of her application.
        </p>
    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Issue 1: Can send potentially invalid arithmetic operations through post request
                <ul>
                    <li>Location:/sendLocation API in index.js</li>
                    <li>Severity: Low. It's unlikely that this would be maliciously
                        exploited, but this could potentially pass in invalid
                        coordinates into the checkins database.
                    </li>
                    <li>Description: When POSTing location data to the server, it
                        is possible to insert arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
                        as valid numerical values. Unlike values normally outside the
                        standard lat/lng range, arithmetic expressions with normally
                        invalid results such as "100*100" can be inserted with no
                        error handling.
                    </li>
                    <li>Resolution: Adding an extra check when the lat and lng
                        are received to ensure that either there are no arithmetic
                        operators in the request, or computing the result of the
                        arithmetic operation and then deciding if the result is
                        invalid
                    </li>
                    <img src="arithmetic.png" alt="Theoretically invalid coordinate entries">
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Issue 2: Potential for DDOS attacks
                <ul>
                    <li>Location:/sendLocation API in index.js</li>
                    <li>Severity: Low to medium, depending on the exposure or
                        popularity of the site. If the site takes off, the potential
                        for DDOS attacks on the /sendLocation route are more likely
                        and are of a greater concern.
                    </li>
                    <li>Description: Essentially, if several users collude to flood
                        the checkins database on Mongo with /sendLocation POST 
                        request, it's not unfeasible to think that the large number
                        of requests could flood the Mongo server and render site
                        functionality ineffective.
                    </li>
                    <li>Resolution: Several requests from the same coordinates in
                        quick succession by the same login could be filtered out.
                        Alternatively, if proxies are being used to rapidly shift
                        locations, there could be a hard cap on the number of requests
                        made per minute on the /sendLocation route.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Issue 3: Enabling CORS with wildcard
                <ul>
                    <li>Location: index.js</li>
                    <li>Severity: High. Since anyone can make a server request,
                        this is easily exploitable by malicious users.
                    </li>
                    <li>Description: When Brinley enables CORS on her server,
                        she uses the wildcard tag, indicating that all domains
                        can send requests to the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>Resolution: By only enabling CORS for known,
                        non-malicious domains, Brinley could filter out
                        requests from more harmful origins.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While there are a few flaws of low to medium consequence, overall,
            Brinley's application is very effective in screening potential
            HTML element and script injections, as well as preventing most kinds
            of bad coordinate inputs. Most of her issues are either easy fixes or
            issues that would only arise when scaling the app.
