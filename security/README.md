## Assignment 4: Security
## Michael Morisi

## What has been correctly implemented? What has not?

Things that come to mind for correct implementation are:
* Basic HTML page with images loads correctly
* All sections of the Security assignment have been written

Nothing that comes to mind could have been implemented better, though it was
hard to find security flaws when my partner had already built their site
with certain security ideas in mind.
