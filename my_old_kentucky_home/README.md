## What has been correctly implemented? What has not?

Things that come to mind for correct implementation are:
* Lyrics display with the correct timing in sync with the video
* Lyrics only begin when the video begins
* Images display correctly
* css functions properly

Nothing that comes to mind could have been implemented better.
