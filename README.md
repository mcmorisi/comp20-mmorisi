# Comp 20
## Michael Morisi

## What is this purpose of this Git repository?
This repository contains labs and homework assignments for the Comp 20 course at
Tufts University. Included are web pages and related files that span skills and
concepts such as basic HTML and CSS design, responsive design, Node.js
programming, and usage of external APIs.

## What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was the Landmarks assignment, since it really felt
like I was building a useful application with clearly visible results
all on my own. It also felt like a step up from the projects in Comp 11 and 15
due to the results of my code being more "high-level" in appearance compared
to command-line programs.

## How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think I have learned many new skills (JQuery, Node.js) as well as markedly
improved in some pre-existing ones (HTML/CSS) to the point where I feel comfortable
putting them on a resume and potentially exploring a career in web development.

## What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
I believe the most important thing that I learned in this course was learning how
to build applications using external APIs. In this course, I used both the Google Maps
API in the Landmarks project, as well as the Google Places API in the final group project.
Using APIs made me feel my programming get even closer to professional levels, and being able to
navigate external, professional-grade interfaces in a classroom setting was a first for me.

## Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I'd like to learn more about templating tools like Jade, as well as more about server-side
scripting languages like Ruby on Rails.
