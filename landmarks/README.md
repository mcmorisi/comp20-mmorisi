## Assignment 2: Landmarks

## What has been correctly implemented? What has not?

Things that come to mind for correct implementation are:
* Map displays correctly
* XML request runs smoothly
* All markers are correctly placed
* Distances are correctly calculated
* Polyline displays as intended (when the user's icon is clicked)

Nothing that comes to mind could have been implemented better.
