## What has been correctly implemented? What has not?

Things that come to mind for correct implementation are:
* Messages display correctly in proper order
* Input box clears upon hitting enter key
* Messages are preserved upon refreshing the page (saved in localStorage)

Nothing that comes to mind could have been implemented better.
* Blank messages should not be permitted

## Acknowledgements
* None
